## Welcome to My TED Talk :)

I'm not really sure if this app was worth the amount of effort and lack of sleep I put into it, but now that I'm writing this, I'm sort of proud of what I was able to make without any knowledge of JavaScript, React, API's, and Node.js. To be honest, my knowledge on them is still pretty limited, but I think I made decent progress (hopefully). If I had more time, I would take the time to learn everything better first rather than trying to rush to make the project. Then, I would try to make the app cleaner overall by implementing musixmatch (I tried, but I couldn't figure out how to choose a random song from the data I received from https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?q_artist=taylor%20swift&apikey=b50b01f80c8cf544e3640e6c645527fc&page_size=100&page=1&f_has_lyrics&f_lyrics_language=en). I would also make a backend rather than relying on a random TaylorSwift lyric API. I would also add, commit, and push more, but I didn't really know which project folder I'd end up using for the actual challenge and which would just be practice. There are also some quality improvements to make. Anyways, thanks for reading!

The .env was for my musixmatch key. I kept it in to try to see if I could implement musixmatch in the future or something, but I wasn't able to before this deadline.

## Welcome to My TED Talk :)

This is a basic React app that displays random Taylor Swift lyrics to the user and prompts them to guess which song it belongs to. The album can be selected by the user, and the API used is https://taylorswiftapi.herokuapp.com/. This project was done in order to learn basic fullstack developing. Prior to this project, I had no experience to React, Node.js, and APIs in general. I hope you enjoy!

The .env was for my musixmatch key. I kept it in to try to see if I could implement musixmatch in the future or something.
